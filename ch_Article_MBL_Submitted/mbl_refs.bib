Abstract = {We survey the recent progress made in understanding nonequilibrium dynamics in closed random systems. The emphasis is on the important role played by concepts from quantum information theory and on the application of systematic renormalization group methods to capture universal aspects of the dynamics. Finally, we outline some outstanding open questions, which include the description of the many-body-localization phase transition and the identification of physical systems that allow systematic experimental study of these phenomena. },

The spectral energy density associated with the higher frequencies is found to be governed by a diffusion equation, in accordance with classical predictions. The elastodynamic energy at the lower frequencies, however, where wavelengths are comparable to microscale, is observed to be transported with greatly diminished efficiency. This absence of transport is ascribed to Anderson localization of the normal modes of vibration. Localization lengths at least as short as 10 cm, or about 20 times larger than the microscale are observed. An anomalous very slow transport over length scales beyond the localization length is also observed."

Abstract = {Some one-dimensional disordered interacting quantum systems have been theoretically predicted to display a property termed many-body localization (MBL), where the system retains the memory of its initial state and fails to thermalize. However, proving experimentally that something does not occur is tricky. Instead, physicists have proposed monitoring the entanglement entropy of the system, which should grow logarithmically with evolution time in an MBL system. Lukin et al. observed this characteristic logarithmic trend in a disordered chain of interacting atoms of rubidium-87. This method should be generalizable to other experimental platforms and higher dimensions.Science, this issue p. 256An interacting quantum system that is subject to disorder may cease to thermalize owing to localization of its constituents, thereby marking the breakdown of thermodynamics. The key to understanding this phenomenon lies in the system{\textquoteright}s entanglement, which is experimentally challenging to measure. We realize such a many-body{\textendash}localized system in a disordered Bose-Hubbard chain and characterize its entanglement properties through particle fluctuations and correlations. We observe that the particles become localized, suppressing transport and preventing the thermalization of subsystems. Notably, we measure the development of nonlocal correlations, whose evolution is consistent with a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, the hallmark of many-body localization. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in noninteracting, disordered systems.},
