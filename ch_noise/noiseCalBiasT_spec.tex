We show the basic circuit analysis and the physical implementation for the Bias T that we use for the noise spectra calibration.  We use a SPICE simulation to check that this circuit will work up to at least 100\,MHz.

\subsection{Schematic}

We know from experiments that the calibration works well when the Agillent AWG outputs a 5V sin wave through a 70db attenuator to the qubit.
Here we design a bias-T that gives 70 dB power attenuation between the AWG and the qubit using voltage division.  

The schematic for the bias T is shown in Fig,\,\ref{fig.circuit_diagram}.
The circuit as seen by the AWG is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig.circuit_as_seen_by_awg}.

The condition on the resistor R (to get 70\,dB attn)  is
\begin{align}
70 &= 20 \log_{10}\left({\frac{V_a}{V_c}}\right) \\
\frac{10^{3.5}}{2} &= \frac{V_b}{V_c} \, .
\end{align}
From the divider equation
\begin{align}
V_c &= V_b \frac{25}{R + 25} \\
R &= \frac{25}{2}10^{3.5} - 25 = 39.5 \, \text{K} \Omega \, .
\end{align}

We should check how much current will go to the DAC assuming $\text{V}_a = 5 \, \text{V}$.
The current going to the DAC is $\frac{1}{2} \left( 2.5 \, V / 39.5 \, \text{K} \Omega \right) = 32 \, \mu A$, since half of the current across R goes to the DAC.

To get a crude idea if we need to worry about microwave problems we calculate the on-chip wavelength at 100\,MHz assuming $\epsilon_{\text{substrate}} = 4.6$:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{r} = (1+\epsilon_{\text{substrate}})/2 = 2.8\,\epsilon_0 \, .
\end{equation}
The propagation velocity on board is $c/\sqrt{\epsilon_r} = 1.8 \times 10^8$ m/sec.
So our 100 MHz signal has a wavelength of 1.8\,m.
This should be fine, we'll just make the board small.

\begin{comment}
To check how "Microwavy" The board needs to be lets calculate the wavelength at 100 MHz which is roughly the high end of the range that we wish to calibrate.  Since we build the board out of FR4 which has $\epsilon$=4.6 our $\epsilon_{r}$ is (1+4.6)/2 = 2.8 $\epsilon_0$.

In typical operation port 4 of the device is 50 $\Omega$ terminated.

\subsection{Physical Implementation}

{fig.pcb}

The physical layout of the board is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig.pcb}.
The geometry of the transmission line is a GCPW.
I'm assuming a board thickness of .062 mil = 1.57 mm since this is compatible with the 50\,$\Omega$ connector that we often use in the lab (Johnson Components \#: 142-0701-801).

For the transmission line parameters in the spice model I got $Z_0$ and $\epsilon_{relative}$ from the online calculator for the gcpw at http://chemandy.com/calculators/coplanar-waveguide-with-ground-calculator.htm.
I used the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon_{\text{substrate}} = 4.6$
\item $\text{track width} = 1.2\,\text{mm}$
\item $\text{gap width} = 0.2\,\text{mm}$
\item $\text{board thickness} = 1.57\,\text{mm}$
\end{itemize}
This gave $\epsilon_{\text{eff}} = 2.879$ and characteristic impedance of  $50.16\,\Omega$.

\subsection{SPICE Simulation}
We perform a SPICE simulation to predict the maximum operating frequency for the calibration.

We convert the calculated $Z_0$ and $\epsilon_r$ to $L_l$ and $C_l$ since these are the inputs required by SPICE:
\begin{itemize}
\item $Z_0 = \sqrt{L_l / C_l}$
\item $\nu_p = 1/\sqrt{L_l C_l} = 1 / (\mu_0 \epsilon_r \epsilon_0) = \nu_c / \sqrt{\epsilon_r}$
\item $C_l = (Z_0 \nu_p)^{-1}$
\item $L_l = Z_0 / \nu_p$
\end{itemize}
For this geometry we have $L_l = 283\,\text{nH/m}$ and $C_l = .112\,\text{nF/m}$.
We plug these values into the SPICE schematic shown below in Fig.\,\ref{fig.SPICE_schematic}.

{
The bias-T SPICE simulation results (with bad rendering) with a voltage probe across the qubit resistor R2.
This shows that at 100\,MHz the change in response is 0.01 dB.
There is less than 1\,dB change until above 700\,MHz.
We see that the DC calculation was well within our error tolerance for this part.}
{fig:SPICE_data}

To give a shorter stub connecting the P12 transmission line we move the resistor R asymmetrically toward that line.  We also add the parasitics of the capacitor to give a more realistic performance.

We see that with the parasitics this part will not work up to 100 MHz.  We can achieve the performance that we want by reducing the Resistance and attenuating the source to give the desired output.  Reducing R to $10$\,$K\Omega$ is simulated below.

\begin{comment}
To predict the maximum frequency of operation for this bias T were going to do a SPICE simulation of the circuit below where the parasitic capacitance is from a COMSOL simulation.
