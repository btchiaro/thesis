%% Seems unused?  \bibitem{qiplotfn} Following the resonator measurements, several devices were found to have some residual photo resist from fabrication.  Since the best performing device was observed to have resist remaining after the striping procedure and only the best device from each film is reported here, it is unlikely that this significantly limited the stated performance of any film.

	Abstract = {To use highly resistive material for Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID), new designs have to be done, in part due to the impedance match needed between the KID chip and the whole 50 $\Omega$ readout circuit. Chips from two new hybrid designs, with an aluminum throughline coupled to titanium nitride microresonators, have been measured and compared to a TiN only chip. In the hybrid chips, parasitic temperature dependent box resonances are absent. The dark KID properties have been measured in a large set of resonators. A surprisingly long lifetime, up to 5.6 ms is observed in a few KIDs. For the other more reproducible devices, the mean electrical Noise Equivalent Power is {\$}5.4 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}-19{\}}{\backslash} {\backslash}mathrm{\{}W{\}}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$}.},

	Abstract = {Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, or MKIDs, have proven to be a powerful cryogenic detector technology due to their sensitivity and the ease with which they can be multiplexed into large arrays. A MKID is an energy sensor based on a photon-variable superconducting inductance in a lithographed microresonator, and is capable of functioning as a photon detector across the electromagnetic spectrum as well as a particle detector. Here we describe the first successful effort to create a photon-counting, energy-resolving ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared MKID focal plane array. These new Optical Lumped Element (OLE) MKID arrays have significant advantages over semiconductor detectors like charge coupled devices (CCDs). They can count individual photons with essentially no false counts and determine the energy and arrival time of every photon with good quantum efficiency. Their physical pixel size and maximum count rate is well matched with large telescopes. These capabilities enable powerful new astrophysical instruments usable from the ground and space. MKIDs could eventually supplant semiconductor detectors for most astronomical instrumentation, and will be useful for other disciplines such as quantum optics and biological imaging.},

	Abstract = {The lack of efficient x-ray detectors is often the main factor limiting the effective use of ever more powerful synchrotron light sources. Spectroscopic X-ray detectors are used for a wide variety of synchrotron experiments including X-ray micro/nano-probes and X-ray absorption spectroscopy for biology and geophysical applications. The current state-of-art spectroscopic X-ray detectors are semiconductor devices, and their energy resolutions are approaching their theoretical limit of about 100eV at 6 keV. We describe a detector research and development program to develop the next-generation of high-resolution spectroscopic X-ray detectors using superconducting Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs). With a required energy per charge carrier four orders of magnitude smaller than that of Si, superconducting detectors offer up to two orders of magnitude increase in energy resolution. In addition, KIDs can be optimized for detection of photons ranging in energy from hard X-ray to IR.},

	Abstract = {Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) have recently drawn the attention of the low-temperature detectors community. Easy fabrication, high sensitivity, small time constants and most notably the intrinsic capability to frequency multiplexing open new possibilities to applications that need very large array sizes and/or high speed read-out. Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs) designed and fabricated in our collaboration have already shown good on sky performances, but new developments are needed for future multi-thousands-pixels instruments. In this contribution we present such ongoing developments: a new LEKIDs design, optimized to be dual polarization sensitive; use of new materials such as TiN in order to reach better signal to noise ratios; new solutions to minimize the cross-talk between pixels in order to achieve a better control of the resonance positions in frequency space. We discuss present lab measurements of the optical performances and recent improvements of the read-out electronics.},

	Abstract = {The room temperature oxidation process of thin TiNx films, grown by DC reactive magnetron sputtering, was studied by in-situ and real time spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray reflectivity, Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and stress measurements. The films were deposited at various negative bias voltages (Vb) in order to vary the TiNx stoichiometry and then exposed to several gases and to air at room temperature. The oxidation rate was found to depend strongly on Vb and thus on film stoichiometry. Fast oxidation was observed in films deposited at low |Vb|, that contain nitrogen which is weakly bonded to Ti and can be easily replaced by oxygen. At high |Vb| values (above −80 V) stoichiometric TiN films were developed, that were stable and not prone to oxidation. The results showed that oxidation takes place in the bulk of the film and can proceed up to about 10\% transformation of titanium nitride into titanium oxide. The fastest step in the film oxidation mechanism is diffusion of oxygen along the columnar grain boundary structure, followed by the reaction of oxygen with the weakly bonded TiN. The results suggest that the oxidation process proceeds with different stages involving formation of TiON, followed by a slow stage of TiO2 formation. These microstructural changes are consistent with the evolution of compressive stresses in the films and the increase in film density and thickness and the decrease in surface roughness as determined by X-ray reflectivity.},

Correlation between chemical composition and crystallographic structure of thin films has been determined and presented in the form of the pseudo-equilibrium ternary phase diagram. The atomic N/Ti and O/Ti ratios have been derived from Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements. X-ray diffraction at grazing incidence has revealed formation of defective TiN--TiO solid solutions. The surface roughness estimated from atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface images decreases with increasing oxygen content in the films, in accordance with the progressive sample amorphisation. Impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate that the electrical conductivity changes its character from metallic to semiconducting with increasing oxygen content in TiNxOy thin films.},

	Abstract = {DC reactive sputtering was used to successfully make thin films of titanium oxynitride using titanium metallic target, argon as plasma gas and nitrogen and oxygen as reactive gases. The nitrogen partial pressure was kept constant during every deposition whereas oxygen flow rate was pulsed using a square pattern. The study consisted in analysing the influence of the shape of the pulsed rate on physical properties of these films. In order to adjust the metalloid concentration to get films with a wide range of oxygen-to-nitrogen ratios, the reactive gas pulsing process (RGPP) was used. In this process, the oxygen flow switches ``on'' and ``off'' periodically according to a duty cycle α=tON/T. Electrical conductivity of films measured against temperature was gradually modified from metallic (σ300K=4.42×104Sm−1) to semi-conducting behaviour (σ300K=7.14Sm−1) with an increasing duty cycle. Mechanical properties like nanohardness (Hn) and reduced Young's modulus (Er) of the films were investigated. Experimental values of Hn and Er obtained by nanoindentation at 10\% depth ranged from 15.8 to 5.2GPa and from 273 to 142GPa, respectively. Evolutions of Hn and E against duty cycle were similar. A regular decrease was observed for duty cycle α≤25\% corresponding to the occurrence of TiOxNy phase. Higher duty cycles led to the smallest values of Hn and E and correlated with TiO2 compound composition. At last, the colour variation of these titanium oxynitrides was investigated as a function of α in the L*a*b* colour space. It was related to the chemical composition of the films.},

The properties of the sputtered films were investigated with Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, electrical resistivity and optical reflectivity measurements, X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy. For a given input power to the sputter gun the film properties depend on the gas composition, the bias voltage applied to the substrates and oxygen contamination during sputtering. In addition, it was found that powering the sputter gun with r.f. causes an iron contamination in the films by material sputtered off the plasma confinement shield. This contamination is very much reduced when d.c. is employed to power the sputter gun.},

@article{Vissers2013,
	Abstract = {The structural and electrical properties of Ti--N films deposited by reactive sputtering depend on their growth parameters, in particular the Ar:N2 gas ratio. We show that the nitrogen percentage changes the crystallographic phase of the film progressively from pure α-Ti, through an α-Ti phase with interstitial nitrogen, to stoichiometric Ti2N, and through a substoichiometric TiNx to stoichiometric TiN. These changes also affect the superconducting transition temperature, TC, allowing, the superconducting properties to be tailored for specific applications. After decreasing from a TC of 0.4K for pure Ti down to below 50mK at the Ti2N point, the TC then increases rapidly up to nearly 5K over a narrow range of nitrogen incorporation. This very sharp increase of TC makes it difficult to control the properties of the film from wafer-to-wafer as well as across a given wafer to within acceptable margins for device fabrication. Here we show that the nitrogen composition and hence the superconductive properties are related to, and can be determined by, spectroscopic ellipsometry. Therefore, this technique may be used for process control and wafer screening prior to investing time in processing devices. Contribution of the U.S. government, not subject to copyright.},

	Abstract = {During the sputtering process in Ar gas, the sputtered target atoms and the reflected Ar neutrals from the target have much higher energy than the background gas. In this study, the Thompson distribution and an updated Meyer model based on the elastic energy transfer between two colliding particles were used to obtain energy distributions and average energies for the sputtered metal atoms and the reflected Ar neutrals. An energy dependent elastic collision cross section was incorporated into Meyer's model and a thermalization criterion based on power balance was used. Under typical sputtering conditions (0.5 mTorr and 1000 K Ar, 400 eV incident Ar ion), the model predictions indicate that for Cu, Ti and Ta targets, the sputtered metal atoms have initial average energies from 15 to 22 eV and thermalize with the background Ar gas between 10 and 20 collisions. The reflected Ar neutrals thermalize after about 10 collisions. Depending on the number of collisions, the energy dependent mean free path values of the sputtered metal atoms range from 300 to 100 cm while the mean free path values for the reflected Ar neutrals range from 200 to 100 cm.},

	Abstract = {Carbides and nitrides of transition metals such as Ti attract significant interest since they find a wide field of applications ranging from high-temperature structural materials to contact layers in solar cells. In the present study we report on the influence of the bias voltage on the development of TiCx, TiNy, and TiCxNy films (600--3000 {\AA} thick) developed by magnetron sputtering. The TiCx films were deposited by r.f. magnetron sputtering from TiC targets, while the TiNy and TiCxNy films were deposited by d.c. and r.f. reactive sputtering from Ti and TiC targets, respectively. The bias voltage was varied from 0 to 200 V for all three types of film. In-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used in the energy region 1.5--5.5 eV to monitor film characteristics. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and microhardness measurements were taken to characterize the composition, stoichiometry, structure, quality and integrity of the films as a function of the bias voltage. For the present deposition conditions, the substrate bias voltage was found to have a significant effect on the stoichiometry and structure of all three types of films. The results show that for TiNy, films the substrate bias can promote stoichiometry and structure refinement through resputtering effects. For TiCx and TiCxNy films, substrate bias can influence stoichiometry and structure by increasing reaction probabilities (of carbon and nitrogen, respectively) in the plasma through ionization and plasma activation effects. Mechanistic aspects of the film development process are discussed in view of the in-situ SE results and the post deposition AES, XPS, XRD and microhardness evaluation.},

Ts and Vb have strong effect on the film's microstructural characteristics such as density, grain size and orientation. It was found that deposition at high Ts and Vb promotes the growth of (002) oriented films with density close to the bulk density of stoichiometric TiN, indicating the absence of voids and the growth of stoichiometric TiN. The film hardness and elastic modulus were measured using the continuous stiffness measurements technique. It was found that there exists a direct correlation between the film's mechanical properties and microstructure. The films that exhibit the best mechanical performance are those grown along the (002) orientation and being denser and stoichiometric.},

	Abstract = {Titanium nitride and titanium oxynitride films were deposited by varying the plasma current density from 10 mA/cm2 to 40 mA/cm2 using DC magnetron sputtering at constant gas flow rate and deposition time. Samples were characterized by Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction, XPS, Nanoindentation and colorimetric analysis. Different coloured films like golden, blue, pink and green were obtained at different current densities. At lower current density (10 mA/cm2), golden coloured stoichiometric titanium nitride film was formed. At higher current densities (20, 30 and 40 mA/cm2), non stoichiometric Titanium oxynitride films of colour blue, pink and green were formed respectively. The thickness of the films increased with plasma current density from 43 nm to 117 nm. It was found that the colour variation was not only due to thickness of the film but also due to oxygen atoms replacing the nitrogen positions in TiN lattice. Hardness and Young Modulus of the films were found to decrease from 17.49 GPa to 7.05 GPa and 319.58 GPa--246.77 GPa respectively with increasing plasma current density. This variation of hardness and Young Modulus of the films can be speculated due to change in crystal orientation caused by oxygen incorporation in the films. The film resistivity increased from 16.46 × 10−4 to 3.28 × 10−1 Ω cm for increasing plasma current density caused due to oxygen incorporation in the crystal lattice.},
