\section{Coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator}
The CPW resonator is a ubiquitious resource in superconducting circuits.
Here we state the basic physics of CPW transmission lines, show that an oscillator can be made from a terminated strip of transmission line, and outline the relationship of this device with coherence metrology.
\subsection{The CPW resonator as an LC oscillator}
\quickfig{6 in}{./PDF/CPW_sw_schem_3d.pdf}{A schematic diagram of a coplanar waveguide (CPW), shown in cross section}{CPW}
A coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line consists of a signal electrode that is isolated from a surrounding ground plane.
A cross sectional view of the basic CPW geometry is shown in cross section in fig.~\ref{CPW}.
This device supports a propagating transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode  with phase velocity \cite{Pozar}
\qeqn{v_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{C_l L_l}}}

The capacitance per unit length $C_l$ between the signal electrode and the ground plane is due to the geometry of the electrodes and the relative dielectric constant of the substrate $\epsilon_r$.
$C_l$ can be calculated from Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mapping \cite{GaoThesis}, the result is:
\qeqn{
C_l = \left( \frac{1 + \epsilon_r}{2} \right) \epsilon_0 \frac{4 K(k)}{K(k^\prime)}
}
where $K$ is the elleptic integral of the first kind, $k = S/ \left( S + 2W \right)$, and $k^\prime = \sqrt{1 - k}$.

The total inductance per unit length $L_l$ consists of the geometric $L_g$ as well as kinetic inductance $L_k$,
which can be significant in superconducting devices.
\qeqn{ L_l = L_g + L_k}
%The inductance per unit length $L_l$ has a geometric contribution $L_g$ that can be similarly calculated.
$L_g$ can be calculated in similar fashion to $C_l$ \cite{GaoThesis}
\qeqn{L_g = \frac{\mu_0}{4} \frac{K \left( k^\prime \right)}{K \left( k \right)} }
The kinetic inductance, due to the inertia of superconducting Cooper pairs, is dependent both on the superconducting material and the geometry of the transmission line.
\qeqn{ L_k = g L_s }
The surface inductance of the superconductor $L_s$ depends on the normal metal resistivity and the thickness of the electrode. \cite{KherThesis}
\qeqn{L_s = \frac{ \hslash \rho_n }{ \pi \Delta_0 t} } % Equation 2.13
The geometric factor g can be estimated analyticaly for the CPW geometry \cite{RamiThesis, GaoThesis}
\qeqnarray{
g &=& \frac{1}{4 S (1-k^2) K^2(k)} \left( \pi + \log \frac{4 \pi S}{t} - k \log \frac{1 + k}{1 - k} \right) + \\
  &\phantom{=}& \frac{k}{4 S (1-k^2) K^2(k)} \left( \pi + \log \frac{4 \pi (S + 2 W)}{t} - \frac{1}{k} \log \frac{1 + k}{1 - k} \right) \\
} % end qeqnarray
For high resistivity superconductors, such as titanium nitride considered in Chapter 3, $L_k$ can be significant and even dominate $L_l$.

}{cpw_resonator}

We can construct a quarter wave resonator by terminating a segment of the transmission line in a short circuit to the ground plane.
This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{cpw_resonator}
The resonance condition for the quarter wave resonator can be found from the relation $v_p = f \lambda$.
\qeqn{
f_0 = \frac{1}{4 l }\frac{1}{\sqrt{L_l C_l}}
\label{f0_resonator}
}
A consequence of eq.~\ref{f0_resonator} is that high kinetic inductance materials can make resonators smaller in size while maintaining a constant frequency resonator.
However, eq.~\ref{f0_resonator} also implies that in high kinetic inductance devices,
the materials parameters (thin film resistivity) must be tightly controlled to prevent inductance variability.
%A drawback is of sensitivity of $L_k$ is that if the materials properties such as $\rho_2$ are not well controlled,

%From Pozar (eqn 6.28 we find that the input resistance of a segment of lossy transmission line that is terminated in a short circuit is)
Following  \cite{Pozar}, it is apparent that a terminated segment of lossy transmission line should behave like a damped parallel RLC oscillator by inspecting the input impedance of such a line
\qeqn{
Z_{in} = Z_0 \tanh \left( \alpha + i \beta \right) l = Z_0 \frac{1 - i \tanh \alpha l \cot \beta l}{\tanh \alpha l - i \cot \beta l}
}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the attenuation and propagation parameters of a TEM wave on the line.
For a transmisssion line with small loss and near resonance so that $\omega = \omega_0 + \Delta \omega$ this is approximated as
\qeqn{
Z_{in} = \frac{1}{1/R + 2 i \Delta \omega / 2 \omega_0}
}
which has the same form as $Z_{in}$ for a parallel RLC oscillator.

\subsection{Coherence metrology with CPW resonators}

\subsubsection{Resonator qubit relationship}
%It's simplicity means that the resonator can be iterated rapidly.
%good tool to dissect problems, (fab complications not conflated with actual physics)

The superconducting qubit considered later in this chapter is also a weakly damped LC oscillator.
The damping is important because it causes relaxation events of the variety sketched in fig.~\ref{schem relaxation dephasing}(a),
which in turn contribute to the qubit's logical error rate.
Thus, in order to achieve the best qubit performance the dissipation must be minimized.

Throughout the history of superconducting qubits the resonator has been used for coherence engineering.
This is because superconducting qubits and resonators are subject to many of the same dissipation mechanisms,
including quasiparticle loss, magnetic vortex loss, and dielectric loss.
This is not surprising given the similarity of their construction.
Fig.~\ref{qubit_resonator}(a) shows an Xmon transmon superconducting qubit.
It can be thought of as two intersecting strips of CPW transmission line,
such as those that create the CPW resonator in Fig.~\ref{qubit_resonator}(c).
However, the resonator has the virtue of being much simpler than the qubit.
This permits rapid fabrication iterations and protects against the performance degradation that sometimes results from complex multi-step fabrication sequence.
For both of these reasons, the resonator is widely used in the material science and fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits.

\vspace*{2em}

\subsubsection{Quality factor}
The figure of merit describing resonator dissipation is the quality factor $Q$,
which characterizes the rate at which energy stored in the resonator is lost from it.  $Q$ is the number of oscillations
the circuit performs within one energy relaxation time constant, which can in turn be related to the qubit relaxation time $T_1$.
\qeqn{ Q = \frac{\omega E}{P} = \omega T_1}

The rate at which which energy is lost from the resonator depends both on its coupling to external circuitry as well as its internal dissipation so that
\qeqn{1/Q_{total} = 1/Q_{c} + 1/Q_{i}}
where $Q_c$ and $Q_i$ refer to the coupling and internal quality factors respectively.
Note that the quality factors sum in reciprocal since the energy loss rates are additive.
The internal quality factor $Q_i$ may be further decomposed in terms of the constituent loss mechanisms.
\qeqn{1/Q_{i} = 1/Q_{quasiparticle} + 1/Q_{vortex} + 1/Q_{dielectric}}

For a quarter wave resonator capacitively coupled to a transmission line, the internal quality factor $Q_i$
and the coupling quality factor $Q_c$ can be extracted
separately from simple transmission measurements.
This is done by parametrically fitting measurements of transmission S - parameter $S_{21}$ vs frequency.\cite{Megrant2012}
\qeqn{ S_{21}^{-1} = 1 + \frac{Q_i}{Q_c}\,\frac{1}{1 + i 2 Q_i \left( \frac{f - f_0}{f_0} \right) } }
In chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis we focus on minimizing the internal dissipation $\frac{1}{Q_i}$ to improve the relaxation times of our qubits.
Further discussion of the setup of such an experiment can be found in chapter 4 and appendix\,\ref{ch:Vortex-supp}.
%When using the resonator for coherence engineering, the primary performance metric is the internal quality factor $Q_i$.
%We characterize the dissipation of the resonator by its internal quality factor.
\draftcomment{
\subsubsection{Dielectric loss}

Under the common operating conditions for superconducting qubits, the quality factor is often limited by dielectric loss.

For in chapters 3 and 4, the role of the resonator is for coherence metrology.

The linear resonator is an LC harmonic oscillator.
The resonator is used in such diverse applications as the mediation of qubit-qubit coupling \rd{cite IBM, UCSB}, Purcell filtering \rd{cite Dan}, dispersive readout \rd{cite Dan and someone else}, and as a coherence metrology tool.
Although all the of qubit measurements in this thesis make use of dispersive measurement, in chapter~\ref{ch:TiN} and chapter~\ref{ch:vortex} we focus on the use of the CPW resonator as a coherence metrology tool.

\subsection{Implementation}
A common way to implement the resonator is to terminate a length of coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission line with a short circuit to the surounding ground plane.

We begin by following Pozar

The quarter wave resonance condition is satisfied when
\rd{
\qeqn{ f \frac{\lambda}{4} = \nu}
}
Where f is the fundamental frequency of the resonator, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $\nu$ is the propagation velocity.

It has a propagation velocity on chip of
\qeqn{\nu = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} } where the L and C are the inductance and capacitance per unit length.

The propagation velocity is determined by the capacitance and inductance per unit length $C_l$ and $L_l$.
The geometric contributions to $C_l$ and $L_l$ are calculated in \rd{Gao thesis}.
For superconducting resonators $L_l$ has an additional contribution due to the kinetic inductance.
The kinetic inductance fraction $\alpha = \frac{L_k}{L_g + L_k}$ depends on the surface inductance of the superconducting material as well as the thickness of the thin film.
$\alpha$ is a few percent for Aluminum resonators, but can dominate $L_l$ for superconducting materials with large normal metal resistivity, such as Titanium Nitride considered in Chapter~\ref{ch:TiN}.

Near resonance the $\lambda / 4$ resonator can be modeled as a parallel LCR oscillator \rd{cite Mazin, gao, Zmoidzinas, day, ...} where the resistance R describes dissipation in the circuit.
The dissipation is often reported in terms the quality factor of the resonator $Q = \frac{\omega E}{P}$ where E is the energy stored in the resonator and P is the power dissipated by it.
The rate at which which energy is lost from the resonator depends both on its coupling to external circuitry as well as its internal dissipation so that
$1/Q_{total} = 1/Q_{c} + 1/Q_{i}$ where $Q_c$ and $Q_i$ refer to the internal and coupling quality factors respectively.

The internal quality factor $Q_i$ quantifies the loss that is internal to the resonator.  It is determined by many of the same
loss mechanisms as determine $T_1$ in qubit circuits, making it a valuable diagnostic tool for coherence engineering.
It suffers from many of the same loss mechanisms as qubit devices, but is much simpler to fabricate.
These loss mechanisms include dielectric loss, magnetic vortex loss, and quasiparticle loss.
Thermal quasiparticles loss can be mitigated by operating the device at low temperatures relative to the superconducting gap.
Nonequilibrium quasiparticles, such as those that arise from irradiating the device with photons at energies greater than the gap,
can be suppressed by using light tight shielding for the operating environment as well as in line IR filters for the control wires.

\section{Quantum LC Oscillator}
\quickwidefig{1 in}{./PDF/LCO.pdf}{An LC oscillator with position and momentum coordinates $\Phi$ and $Q$}{LCO}
The linear LC harmonic oscillator is closely related to the more complicated qubit circuits
and provides an excellent starting point for understanding superconducting qubits.
At low temperatures the LC oscillator behaves quantum mechanically.
As such it's dynamics in this regime are described by the Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
    i \hbar \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\psi(t)} = H \ket{\psi}
\end{equation}
Here we derive the Hamiltonian and show that the LC oscillator behaves as a harmonic oscillator.

The instantaneous power dissipated by a circuit element is
\qeqn{P=IV}
and therefore the energy stored within a lossless element can be written as
\qeqn{ E = \int_{t^\prime = t_0}^{t^\prime=t} I(t^\prime) V(t^\prime) dt^\prime }
$t_0$ is normally taken to be $- \infty$, at which time $I(- \infty)=0$ and $V(- \infty)=0$.

The customary approach for deriving the Hamiltonian $H$ is to write down the Lagrangian for a generalized coordinate of the circuit and compute $H$ via the Lagendre transformation.
This approach ensures that we arrive at a Hamiltonian in terms of a generalized coordinate and it's conjugate momentum.
We choose the flux $\Phi$, indicated in Fig.~\ref{LCO}, as our generalized coordinate.  $\Phi$ is also known as the node flux or branch flux.  $\Phi$ is defined in terms of the voltage across the inductor.
\qeqn{\Phi(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} V(t^\prime) dt^\prime}

\noindent
The current I and voltage V at the node are simply related to $\Phi$
\qeqn{ I = \Phi / L}
\qeqn{ V = \dot{\Phi}}
We can also write the energy of the capacitor and inductor in terms of \Phi.
\qeqn{ E_{capacitor} =
\int_{t^\prime = t_0}^{t^\prime=t} I(t^\prime) V(t^\prime) dt^\prime =
\int_{t^\prime = t_0}^{t^\prime=t} C \frac{dV}{dt^\prime} V(t^\prime) dt^\prime =
\frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \frac{1}{2} C \dot{\Phi}^2 }
and
\qeqn{ E_{inductor} =
\int_{t^\prime = t_0}^{t^\prime=t} I(t^\prime) V(t^\prime) dt^\prime =
\int_{t^\prime = t_0}^{t^\prime=t} I(t^\prime) L \frac{dI}{dt^\prime} dt^\prime =
\frac{1}{2} L I^2 = \frac{1}{2 L} \Phi^2 }

\noindent
By associating the potential energy with the position dependent term and the kinetic energy with the velocity dependent term we can write the Lagrangian for the system
\qeqn{ \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{T} - \mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} C \dot{\Phi}^2 - \frac{\Phi^2}{2L}}
We calculate the momentum conjugate to $\Phi$ by differentiating the Lagrangian.
\qeqn{ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\Phi}} = C \dot{\Phi} = C V = Q}
We recognize the conjugate momentum as the charge on the capacitor and hence denominate it Q.
The Hamiltonian $H$ is obtained from $\mathcal{L}$ as
\qeqn{
H = Q \dot{\Phi} - \mathcal{L} = C \dot{\Phi}^2 -  (\frac{1}{2} C \dot{\Phi}^2 - \frac{\Phi^2}{2L} ) =
\frac{1}{2} C \dot{\Phi^2} + \frac{\Phi^2}{2L}
\label{H_LC_Lagrangian}
}
or
\qeqn{H = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 + \frac{1}{2} L I^2 }
which is the sum of the electric energy stored in the capacitor and the magnetic energy stored in the inductor.

The quantum mechanical Hamiltonian for the electrical LC oscillator can be obtained by substituting the flux and charge operators $\hat{\Phi}$ and $\hat{Q}$
in place of classical coodinate $\Phi$ and momentum $Q$ in Eq.~\ref{H_LC_Lagrangian}.
\begin{equation}
    H = \frac{\hat{Q}^2}{2C} + \frac{\hat{\Phi}^2}{2L}
\end{equation}
We recognize this as the Hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator in the charge and flux coordinates.
Thus the device inherits the properties of a harmonic oscillator.
% The mechanical "mass on a spring" harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian is written
% qeqn{H_{SHO} = \frac{
The operators representing the conjugate variables obey the commutation relation
\qeqn{ \left[ \hat{\Phi}, \hat{Q} \right] = i \hbar}
Additionally, we get the familiar ladder of energy levels.
\qeqn{E_n = \hbar \omega_0 \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) }
Where we have introduced the characteristic frequency
\qeqn{\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ L C } } }

We can also express the annihiliation and creation operators in terms of the charge and flux operators:
\qeqn{ \hat{a} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \hslash Z_0} } \left( \hat{\Phi} + i \hat{Q} Z_0 \right) \label{ho_ann_op}}
and
\qeqn{ \hat{a}^\dagger = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \hslash Z_0} } \left( \hat{\Phi} - i \hat{Q} Z_0 \right) \label{ho_cre_op}}
where we have introduced the characteristic impedance
\qeqn{Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} }

The Hamiltonian is often expressed in terms of the annihilation and creation operators:
\qeqn{ H = \hbar \omega_0 \left( \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \hbar \omega_0 \left( \hat{n} + \frac{1}{2} \right) }

\noindent
The use of the number operator $\hat{n} = \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a}$ makes it clear that the eigenstates of the system are Fock states corresponding to the number
of photonic excitations in the oscillator.
The equal spacing of the energy levels makes the linear harmonic oscillator unusable as a qubit because we cannot drive the
$\ket{0} \rightarrow \ket{1}$ transition independently of the $\ket{1} \rightarrow \ket{2}$ and higher transitions since all of the transitions are at the same frequency.
This challenge is resolved by introducing nonlinearity into the circuit by incorporating a Josephson inductance.

It is convenient to write $H$ in terms of the number of charges on the island $\hat{n}$ and the phase across the inductor $\hat{\phi}$.

\qeqn{ \hat{n} = \frac{\hat{Q}}{2 e} }

\qeqn{ \hat{\phi} = \frac{2 \pi \hat{\Phi}}{\Phi_0} }
where $e$ is the electronic charge and we have introduced the magnetic flux quantum
\qeqn{ \Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2 e} }

\noindent
We define the charging energy as
\qeqn{ E_c = \frac{e^2}{2 C} }
and the inductive energy
\qeqn{E_L = \frac{ \Phi_0^2 }{4 \pi^2 L} }
In these coordinates
\qeqn{H = 4 E_c \hat{n}^2 + \frac{1}{2} E_l \hat{\phi}^2 \label{H_lc_n_phi}}

\draftcomment{
\rd{
For our dynamics we use time independent Hamiltonians.
So we can use:
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi(t)} = e^{-i H t / \hbar}
\end{equation}

The LC oscillator is the electric analog to the simple harmonic oscillator.
Whereas in the mass on a spring simple harmonic oscillator energy oscillates between kinetic and potential, in the LC oscillator energy oscilates between the electric and magnetic fields.

The energy on the capacitor is $E_c = 1/2 C V^2$, and the inductor has an energy of $E = 1/2 L I^2$

\section{Coupled resonators}
The advantages of quantum computing stem from the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension as we combine quantum systems.
Useful quantum circuits, therefore, must provide a means for multiple qubits to interact.
For superconducting qubits the coupling mechanism may be either capacitive or inductive in nature.
In this section we show how these coupling mechanisms lead to a hopping term in the Hamiltonian.

%\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Capacitive coupling}

The circuit diagram for two capacitively coupled oscillators is shown in Fig.\,~\ref{lco_cap_coupled}
\quickfig{3 in}{./PDF/lco_cap_coupled.pdf}{Two capacitively coupled LC oscillators}{lco_cap_coupled}
Maintaining the convention of associating the node fluxes $\Phi$ with potential energy and the node charges $Q$ with kinetic energy,
we can immediately write down the Lagrangian for the capacitively coupled system.

\qeqn{ \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{T} - \mathcal{U} =
\left[
\frac{1}{2} C_1 \dot{\Phi}^2_1 +
\frac{1}{2} C_2 \dot{\Phi}^2_2 +
\frac{1}{2} C_c \left( \dot{\Phi_1} - \dot{\Phi_2} \right)^2
\right] -
\left[ \frac{1}{2 L_1} \Phi_1^2 + \frac{1}{2 L_2}\Phi_2^2
\right]
}
Which can be written as
\qeqn{
\mathcal{L} =
\frac{1}{2} \bm{\dot{\Phi}}^T \bm{C} \bm{\dot{\Phi}} -
\frac{1}{2} \bm{\Phi}^T \bm{L}^{-1} \bm{\Phi}
}
\noindent
Where
\qeqn{
\bm{\Phi} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \Phi_1 \\
    \Phi_2
\end{bmatrix}
\text{,}\,
\bm{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    C_1 + C_c & -C_c \\
    -C_c      &  C_2 + C_c \\
\end{bmatrix}
\text{, and}\,
\bm{L} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    L_1 & 0 \\
    0             &  L_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
}

We find the conjugate momenta by differentiating the Lagrangian:
\qeqn{ Q_1 = \frac{ \partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{\Phi_1} } = C_1 \dot{\Phi_1} + C_c(\dot{\Phi_1}-\dot{\Phi_2})}
\qeqn{ Q_2 = \frac{ \partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{\Phi_2} } = C_2 \dot{\Phi_2} + C_c(\dot{\Phi_2}-\dot{\Phi_1})}

We can solve for the $\dot{\Phi}$ in terms of the $Q_i$ by writing the above expressions as a matrix equation.

\qeqn{
\begin{bmatrix}
    Q_1 \\
    Q_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    C_1 + C_c & -C_c \\
    -C_c      &  C_2 + C_c \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dot{\Phi_1}\\
    \dot{\Phi_2}
\end{bmatrix}
}
or
\qeqn{ Q = C \dot{\Phi} }
We can invert this expression to get the $\dot{\Phi_1}$ and $\dot{\Phi_2}$ in terms of the
cannonical momenta of the coupled system.
\qeqn{
\begin{bmatrix}
    \dot{\Phi_1}\\
    \dot{\Phi_2}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\mathbf{C}^{-1} \mathbf{Q}
=
\frac{1}{ (C_1 + C_c)(C_2 + C_c) - C_c^2 }
\begin{bmatrix}
    C_2 + C_c & C_c \\
    C_c      &  C_1 + C_c \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    Q_1 \\
    Q_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    C^{-1}_{11} & C^{-1}_{12} \\[2.0ex]
    C^{-1}_{21} & C^{-1}_{22} \\[2.0ex]

\\
\begin{bmatrix}
    Q_1 \\
    Q_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\label{Phidot_in_terms_of_Q}
}

\inprogress{
We can write the Lagrangian in terms of the $Q_i$.
Since:
\qeqn{Q = C \dot{\Phi} \implies \dot{\Phi} = C^{-1} Q }
and
\qeqn{\dot{\Phi}^T = \left( C^{-1} Q \right)^T \implies \dot{\Phi}^T = Q^T {C^{-1}}^T  \implies \dot{\Phi}^T = Q^T C^{-1} }
Now we can write the lagrangian in terms of the node fluxes and the conjugate charges.
\qeqn{
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} Q^T C^{-1} Q - \frac{1}{2} \Phi^T L^{-1} \Phi

\left[ \frac{1}{2 L_1} \Phi_1^2 + \frac{1}{2 L_2}\Phi_2^2 \right]
\label{lagrangian_Phi_Q_explicit}
}

The Hamiltonian is
\qeqn{H = \sum_i \dot{x}_i \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}_i} - \mathcal{L} =
\sum_i \dot{x}_i p_i - \mathcal{L} = \sum_i \dot{\Phi}_i Q_i - \mathcal{L}
\label{Hamiltonian_general_Phidot_Q}
}
We can compute the sum by \ref{Phidot_in_terms_of_Q} and \ref{Lagrangian_Phi_Q} into \ref{Hamiltonian_general_Phidot_Q}

\inprogress{
\qeqn{
\dot{\Phi_1} Q_1 + \dot{\Phi_2} Q_2 =

} % end inprogress
So that
\qeqn{

This Hamiltonian is the Hamiltonian of two harmonic oscillators with increased effective capacitances and the addition of a charge - charge interaction.
The third term $C^{-1}_{12} Q_1 Q_2$ is the charge - charge interaction that permits excitations to transfer (swap)
between qubits.
Using the Harmonic oscillator relations in eqns~\ref{ho_ann_op} and \ref{ho_cre_op}
%\qeqn{
%Q_1 Q_2 = - Q0_1 Q0_2 (a_1 - a^\dagger_1)(a_2 - a^\dagger_2) =

\qeqn{
Q_1 Q_2 = (-i)\sqrt{ \frac{\hslash}{2 Z_0^1} }(a_1 - a^\dagger_1) (-i)\sqrt{ \frac{\hslash}{2 Z_0^2} }(a_2 - a^\dagger_2) =

The non photon conserving terms eliminated by the rotating wave approximation since they oscillate rapidly, and quickly average to zero.

\subsection{Inductive coupling}
The gmon circuit considered in this work features fixed capacitive coupling as described above in combination with a tunable inductive coupling.
\quickfig{3 in}{./PDF/lco_ind_coupled.pdf}{Two inductively coupled LC oscillators}{lco_ind_coupled}
Fig.~\ref{lco_ind_coupled} shows the case of two inductively coupled oscillators.
In this case we expect to generate a flux - flux interaction term in the Hamiltonian.

By the definition of mutual inductance we have
\qeqn{\Phi_1 = L_1 I_1 + M I_2}
\qeqn{\Phi_2 = L_2 I_2 + M I_1}

Which can be written as a matrix equation
\qeqn{
\begin{bmatrix}
    \Phi_1 \\
    \Phi_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    L_1 & M \\
    M & L_2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    I_1 \\
    I_2
\end{bmatrix}
}

Which implies
\qeqn{
I = L^{-1} \Phi = \frac{1}{L_1 L_2 - M^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
    L_2 & -M \\
    -M  & L_1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \Phi_{1} \\
    \Phi_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    L^{-1}_{11} & L^{-1}_{12} \\[2.0ex]
    L^{-1}_{21} & L^{-1}_{22} \\[2.0ex]
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    \Phi_{1} \\
    \Phi_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
}

The energy in the inductors is written in terms of the flux variable is
\qeqn{E_{inductor} = \half \mathbf{I}^T \mathbf{L} \mathbf{I} = \half \Phi^T L^{-1} \Phi}

The energy in the capacitors is the same as in the uncoupled case:

\qeqn{E_{capacitor} = \half{} C_1 \dot{\Phi_1}^2 + \half{} C_2 \dot{\Phi_2}^2}% = \half \frac{Q_1^2}{C_1} + \half \frac{Q_2^2}{C_2}}

The full Lagrangian is
\qeqn{
\mathcal{L} =
\left[\half{} C_1 \dot{\Phi_1}^2 + \half{} C_2 \dot{\Phi_2}^2 \right] -
\left[L^{-1}_{11} \Phi^2_1 + L^{-1}_{12} \Phi_1 \Phi_2 + L^{-1}_{21} \Phi_1 \Phi_2 + L^{-1}_{22} \Phi_2^2 \right]
}

The conjugate momenta are
\qeqn{ Q_1 = \frac{ \partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{\Phi_1} } = C_1 \dot{\Phi_1} }
\qeqn{ Q_2 = \frac{ \partial \mathcal{L} }{\partial \dot{\Phi_2} } = C_2 \dot{\Phi_2} }

And finally the Hamiltonian is
\qeqn{ H = \sum_i \dot{\Phi}_i Q_i - \mathcal{L} =
\frac{Q_1^2}{2 C_1} + \frac{Q_2^2}{2 C_2} +
L^{-1}_{11} \Phi^2_1 + 2 * L^{-1}_{12} \Phi_1 \Phi_2 + L^{-1}_{22} \Phi_2^2
}

This is again the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator, but this time with a flux - flux coupling term $L^{-1}_{12} \Phi_1 \Phi_2$
Since $\Phi = 2 \sqrt{\frac{\hslash Z_0}{2}}(a^{\dagger} + a)$ and involking the RWA again, we find
\qeqn{\Phi_1 \Phi_2 \sim (a_1 a_2^\dagger + a_1^\dagger a_2)}
so that the flux - flux coupling also generates a hopping term in the Hamiltonian.


\section{Josephson junction}
As noted above the linear LC oscillator is not suitable for use as a qubit because of its ladder of equally spaced energy levels.
This challenge is addressed by using the nonlinear inductance of a josephson junction in place of the linear inductance considered above.
This nonlinearity creates an unevenly spaced ladder of energy levels and gives rise to an interaction term in the Hamiltonian.
\quickfig{6 in}{./PDF/JJ_image_190908_634p.pdf}{a) A Josephson junction b) The circuit symbol for a Josephson junction}{jj_image}
The Josephson junction provides us with a lossless, nonlinear inductance.\cite{Josephson1962}
The Josephson junction consists of two superconducting electrodes separated by a thin insulating barrier.
This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{jj_image}.
\draftcomment{We follow a derivation due to Van Duzer, cite Josephson
% TODO Give derivation of Josephson effect.}

The Josephson relations for the current through the junction $I_j$ and the voltage across the junction $V$ to the phase:
\qeqn{I_j = I_c \sin \delta }
and
\qeqn{V = \frac{\phi_0}{2\pi}\frac{d\delta}{dt} }
from these we can compute the Josephson inductance
\qeqn{ V = L\frac{dI}{dt} \implies L_j = \frac{\phi_0}{2 \pi I_c \cos \delta} }

%Since the L is L(I), the inductance is nonlinear.

The parameter $I_c$ is known as the critical current, which is related to the normal resistance of the junction via the
Ambegaokar - Baratoff Relation \cite{Ambegaokar1963}
\qeqn{I_c R_n = \frac{\pi \Delta}{2 e} \text{tanh} \left( \frac{\Delta}{2 k_b T} \right)}

The junction is a primarily inductive element that stores energy in the magnetic field.  %  We do work against the junction to increase its energy.
As the Josephson junction is dissipationless, work done on the junction is stored as energy within it.
We can compute this energy from the current, voltage Josephson relations above.
\qeqn{-\frac{dU}{dt} = I V = \left( I_c \sin \phi(t) \right) \left( \frac{\hbar}{2 e}\frac{d\phi}{dt} \right) }
\qeqn{- \int dU = I_c \frac{\hbar}{2 e} \int \sin \phi d\phi }
\qeqn{U = E_J \cos \phi, E_J = I_c \frac{ \hbar }{2e} \label{jj_energy}}

We can configure two Josephson junctions in parallel to form a DC squid.
This device behaves as a Josephson junction with a critical current that is tunable with magnetic flux.
The effective critical current of the DC squid is \cite{vanDuzer1999}
\qeqn{
I_{c}(\Phi_{ext}) = 2 I_c \abs{ \cos{ \frac{ \pi \Phi_{ext} }{\Phi_0} } }
}
The tunability of the SQUID inductance forms the basis for frequency tunable superconducting qubits
and coupling circuits that provide an adjustable interaction strength between the qubits.
Such frequency and coupling tunability are essential capabilities for quantum simulations such as that in chapter 5 of this thesis.

\section{Transmon superconducting qubits}

The transmon is a variety of superconducting qubit that is realized by replacing the linear inductance of an LC oscillator with a Josephson junction.
The resulting device can be thought of as a Josephson junction with a large shunting capacitance, making it a weakly anharmonic LC oscillator.
The idea behind the transmon is that the shunting capacitance exponentially surpresses charge noise by trading away anharmonicity\cite{Koch2007}.

In 2011 a 3D version of the transmon was developed at Yale and demonstrated remarkable coherence properties.\cite{Paik2011}
This is due to the fact that the geometry of the device made it possible to store most of the most of the qubit mode energy in the lossless vacuum, reducing dissipation.
Challenges of this 3D implementation are that they are too large to scale easily, cannot be microfabricated,
and it is difficult to retain the coherence properties when coupling two or more of these devices together.
% TODO image of transmon qubit. Maybe image of 3d transmon qubit. Probably need to request permission
In 2013 planar variant of the transmon,
compatible with standard microfabrication techniques and ammenable to scaled-up multi-qubit systems, was introduced.\cite{Barends2013}
Future iterations saw the device incorporate tunable inter-qubit coupling (gmon).\cite{Chen2014}
This design is the basis for the processor used in the quantum simulation of chapter 5 of this thesis.

%The transmon is a slightly anharmonic oscillator.
%The anharmonicity results from replacing the linear inductor of the LC oscillator with a Josephson junction,
%which provides a nonlinear inductance as described in the previous section.

\subsection{Hamiltonian of the transmon}

We obtain the transmon Hamiltonian by substituting the Josephson junction energy from Eq.~\ref{jj_energy} into the LC oscillator Hamiltonian
Eq.~\ref{H_lc_n_phi} in place of the linear inductor energy.
\qeqn{H = 4 E_c \hat{n}^2 - E_j \cos{\hat{\phi}} \label{H_transmon} }
\inprogress{
A key point here is that increasing the capacitance decreases the charging energy.
Thus by forming the oscillator with a large capacitor the device is less sensitive to fluctuations in the charge.
} % end inprogress

\draftcomment{
In order to operate the oscillator as a qubit, it is essential to make the energy levels anharmonic so that rotations may be driven between specified levels on demand.
The means by which we do this is to replace the linear inductance of our oscillator with a Josephson junction, which behaves like a nonlinear inductor.}

The nonlinear Josephason inductance slightly modifies the level structure of our (nearly) harmonic oscillator so that the energy levels are no longer evenly spaced.
This has at least two important consequences.
1) For uncoupled qubits, we can drive the 0-1 transition without exciting the 1-2 transition.
2) The nonlinearity gives rise to a Hubbard interaction term in the Hamiltonian.
This interaction is fundamental to the design of entangling gates between transmon qubits,
is essential to integrability breaking in analog algorithms,
and leads directly to the many-body entanglement propagation in the localized phase that we observe in the last chapter.

\subsection{Nonlinearity of the transmon old}
As suggested by Koch, the transmon can be thought of as a charged mechanical rotor in magnetic and gravitational fields.
In the transmon limit where Ej/Ec >> 1, the gravitational energy dominates, keeping the reduced flux angle $\varphi$ small.
This justifies a perturbation expansion in $\varphi$ about $\varphi=0$.
With this expansion the potential energy is
\qeqn{U = - Ej + Ej \varphi^2 / 2 - Ej \varphi^4 / 24}
Th quartic term is responsible for the nonlinearity to leading order.

\rd{Koch makes a gauge transformation to eliminate ng after which the Hamiltonian is claimed to be
\qeqn{ H = \sqrt{8 EcEj}(b^\dagger b +1/2)a - Ej - Ec/12(b+b^\dagger)^4 }
}

Here the $b,b^\dagger$ are the standard harmonic oscillator operators.
From perturbation theory, the first order correction to the energies for level n coming from the quartic term is is
\qeqn{\delta E_n =\bra{n} \delta_H \ket{n} =  Ec / 12 \bra{n}|(b + b^\dagger)^4|\ket{n}}
\qeqn{ \bra{n} | b^2 {b^{\dagger}}^2 + b^\dagger b b^\dagger b + b^\dagger b b b^\dagger + b b^\dagger b^\dagger b + b b^\dagger b b^\dagger + {b^{\dagger}}^2 b^2 | \ket{n}}
\qeqn{ \delta E_n = Ec / 12 \left( 6n^2 + 6n + 3 \right) }

Note that the anharmonicity decreases as we decrease the charging energy by increasing the capacitance.
This design choice is to trade away nonlinearity to gain charge noise insensitivity.
} % end draftcomment

\subsection{Nonlinearity of the transmon}
Following \cite{Koch2007, JimmyThesis} we can compute the nonlinearity of the transmon from perturbation theory.
For the purposes of our MBL simulation the nonlinearity gives rise to a Hubbard interaction and facilitates entanglement propagation without excitation transport.
The large $E_j / E_c$ ratio of the transmon motivates an expansion of the cosine potential in $\phi$ about $\phi$ = 0.
%As suggested by Koch, the transmon can be thought of as a charged mechanical rotor in magnetic and gravitational fields.
%In the transmon limit where Ej/Ec >> 1, the gravitational energy dominates, keeping the reduced flux angle $\phi$ small.
%This justifies a perturbation expansion in $\phi$ about $\phi=0$.
With this expansion the potential energy is
\qeqn{U = - E_j + E_j \left( \phi^2  / 2  \right) - E_j \left( \phi^4 / 24 \right)}
The quadratc term combines with the term quadratic in the charge to give a harmonic oscilator with level spacing $\sqrt{8 E_cE_j}$.
The quartic term is responsible for the nonlinearity to leading order.
\qeqn{ H = \sqrt{8 E_cE_j}(a^\dagger a +1/2) - E_j - E_c/12(a+a^\dagger)^4 }
Here the $a,a^\dagger$ are the standard harmonic oscillator annihilation and creation operators operators.
From perturbation theory, the first order correction to the energies for level n coming from the quartic term is is
\qeqn{\delta E_n =\bra{n} \delta_H \ket{n} =  E_c / 12 \bra{n}|(a + a^\dagger)^4|\ket{n}}
\qeqn{ \bra{n} | a^2 {a^{\dagger}}^2 + a^\dagger a a^\dagger a + a^\dagger a a a^\dagger + a a^\dagger a^\dagger a + a a^\dagger a a^\dagger + {a^{\dagger}}^2 a^2 | \ket{n}}
\qeqn{ \delta E_n = E_c / 12 \left( 6n^2 + 6n + 3 \right) }
Note that the anharmonicity decreases as we decrease the charging energy by increasing the capacitance.
This design choice is to trade away nonlinearity to gain charge noise insensitivity.

}{gmon_schematic}

More complex devices, such as the gmon circuit employed in Chapter~\ref{ch:MBL}, can be understood by combining the concepts in the preceding sections \cite{Neill2018}.
A circuit schematic for the gmon is shown in fig.~\ref{gmon_schematic}.
The frequency detuning term $h_i n_i$ can be understood as the energy of an $LC$ harmonic oscillator with frequency $h_i$.
The correction to the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian due to the nonlinearity of the Josephson junctions is represented by term $\frac{U}{2} n (n-1)$.
It should be noted that this can be thought of as a single term in an expansion, it gives $0$ for $n_i = 0, 1$ and $U$ for $n=2$.
This expression is not valid for higher occupations.
Finally, the hopping term $J (a_i a_{i+1}^\dagger + a_i^\dagger a_{i+1})$
arises from the sum of direct capacitive coupling between the qubits and inductive coupling mediated by the coupler circuit shown in green.
In Appendix \ref{ch:analog_control}, we provide benchmarking data confirming that the dynamics of the gmon circuit are described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian shown in fig.~\ref{gmon_schematic}.
